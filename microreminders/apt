 BASIC
 - apt-cache search: search for a package
 - apt-cache show: display information such as version, dependencies
   and description
 - dpkg -L package: show all files from a package
 - dpkg -S 'command' -> returns the package name containing the command.

INSTALLING FROM SRC
 - Instead of "make install", run "sudo checkinstall" to generate a .deb 
   which will allow you to remove the package in the future.
