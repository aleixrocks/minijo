Locales define per-country character display options, such as currency, date
or other special symbols. To set a system's locale, its only needed to specify
the value of the variable LANG=en_US, for example.

 - locale -> list current locale configuration
 - locale -a -> list all current locales installed
 - sudo locale-gen "en_US.UTF-8" -> generate the specified locale
 - To change a locale (in Ubuntu based distros) put in /etc/default/locale:
      LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
      LANG=en_US.UTF-8
