 - Open gimp, select with the rectangle tool what you want to cut. Write down
   the "position" and "size" numbers found in the left pannel (where the
   rectangle tool options lie). Do not use the values shown in the bottom of
   the GIMP toolbar!!
 - Put all pictures in a folder and make a backup.
 - use the mogrify tool to cut all pictures. The syntaxis is:
     mogrify -crop {Width}x{Height}+{X}+{Y} image.pnga
   BE CAREFUL WITH "x" and "+" SIGNS BETWEEN NUMBERS!!!!!!!
   For a rectangle of 1658x286 situated at 1380,726:
     mogrify -crop 1658x286+1380+726 *.png
