- Execution time of a program:
        T = N * CPI * Tc
   * N = Number of instructions to complete the program
   * CPI = Cycles per instruction
   * Tc = 1 / Freq = Seconds it takes to complete one cycle
- Speedup
        Speedup = T1 / Tp
        Speedup = 1 / ( (1 - F) + F/A )
   * T1: Time withouth modifications
   * Tp: TIme with modifications
   * F:  Fraction of time where the modifications can accelerate something
   * A:  Fraction in which time is accelerated

- Hazards
   - structural hazard: A required resource is busy
   - Data hazard: A data element is needed, but not ready.
   - Control hazard: Deciding in control action depends on previous instruction.
