HOW TO CONNECT A LINUX CLIENT WITH AN ANDROID AP
 - Tutorial from: https://blind.guru/tag/bluetooth-pan.html#bluez-5-and-pan
 - Install:
     sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez bluez-tools
 - Check bluetooth is not hardware/software blocked with
    rfkill list
 - Show bluetooth interfaces, it should be named like bnep0
    hciconfig -a
 - Pair both client and AP:
     - bluetoothctl
        [NEW] Controller 00:10:20:30:40:50 pi [default]
        [bluetooth]# agent KeyboardOnly 
        Agent registered
        [bluetooth]# default-agent 
        Default agent request successful
        [bluetooth]# power on
        Changing power on succeeded
        [CHG] Controller 00:10:20:30:40:50 Powered: yes
        [bluetooth]# scan on
        Discovery started
        [CHG] Controller 00:10:20:30:40:50 Discovering: yes
        [NEW] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 myLino
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 LegacyPairing: yes
        [bluetooth]# pair 00:12:34:56:78:90
        Attempting to pair with 00:12:34:56:78:90
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: yes
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: no
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: yes
        Request PIN code
        [agent] Enter PIN code: 1234
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Paired: yes
        Pairing successful
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: no
        [bluetooth]# trust 00:12:34:56:78:90

      - This might not be necessary:

        [bluetooth]# connect 00:12:34:56:78:90
        Attempting to connect to 00:12:34:56:78:90
        [CHG] Device 00:12:34:56:78:90 Connected: yes
        Connection successful
 - Set up the android AP:
     - Turn on Bluetooth tethering 
     - Wait for the device to connect. On the bluetooth device discovery
       window, open the options of the paired device and select "internet
       connection sharing"
 - Bluez5 no longer has pand, so use a third party script.
     - Download bt-pan from
         https://github.com/mk-fg/fgtk/blob/master/bt-pan
       There is a copy of this script in minijo/scripts.
     - Copy the script to /usr/local/sbin
 - For the client side, create the following sysmted scripts. More info can be
   found in man systemd.network
     - /etc/systemd/network/pan-client.network:
          [Match]
          Name=bnep*

          [Network]
          DHCP=yes
     - /etc/systemd/system/pan@.service:
          [Unit]
          Description=Bluetooth Personal Area Network client

          [Service]
          Type=notify
          ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/bt-pan --debug --systemd client %I --wait
     - Be sure that that systemd-networkd daemon is running
         - systemctl status systemd-networkd
         - systemctl start systemd-networkd
         - systemctl enable systemd-networkd
     - Connect to bluetooth AP device specifying the AP MAC with:
         systemctl start pan@CC:FA:00:52:3D:B0 
     - [Optional] Check for errors with
         journalctl -xe
     - Systemd should wake up the dhclient on the interface, however, if it is
       not working, for debuging pruposes it can be enabled manually with:
         dhclient bnep0
     - Test with:
         ping www.google.es



OTHERS
 - To wait for a network interface on a systemd unit:
     [Service]
       ExecStartPre=/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online --interface=bnep0
       ExecStart=...
