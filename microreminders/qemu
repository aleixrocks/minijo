CREATE DISK IMAGE
 - qemu-img create -f qcow2 <disk_name> 50G -> create disk image
 - qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom iso_image -boot d -hda <disk_name> -m 1024 [-vga vmware | -nographic] -enable-kvm -> install iso image into disk
 - qemu-system-x86_64 -hda <disk_name> -m 1024 [ -vga vmware | -nographic ] -enable-kvm -> run disk
 - exit qemu: Ctrl-a x (first press Ctrl-a, release and then x)

BASIC
 -machine [ help | <machine_model> ]: help list the supported emulated machines. The
   nmachine "virt" is a special qemu-exclusive machine to run software without
   emulated hardware details of other architectures. The machine selected might
   enable additional machine-specific command line options for QEMU.
 -bios [none | <path_to_bios_file> ]: Specify a bios firmware to be run before
   a kernel starts. none disables bios load, ideal for bare metal runs.
 -kernel <kernel_path>: boot with this kernel. The image must be a raw binary
   (stripped ELF built as "make Image" or stripped manually as "objcopy -O binary <input> <ouput>"). 
 -M 2G: Specify amount of RAM in gigabytes (also M and K)
 -cpu [ help | <cpu_model> ] : help list available cores, otherwise specify the model to use
 -smp 4: Specicy amout of cores
 -nographic: run qemu in terminal instead of window

BOOTING A LINUX KERNEL
 - We need a raw binary image; without elf headers. "vmlinux" image contains
   elf headers, "Image" has symbols stripped. Therfore, build the kernel as 
    make Image
   or
    make vmlinux; objcopy -S -O binary ./vmlinux ./Image # generates Image from vmlinux

NOGRAPHIC
 - Run qemu directly on the terminal
     qemu -nographic 
 - qemu sends data to your host terminal via serial connection. This means that
   your guest must send data over your serial connection. There are three guest
   components that need to be aware of that: the bootloader, the kernel and
   user-space (systemd).
     - bootloader: TODO (might work out-of-the-box)
     - kernel: pass the parameters "console=tty1 console=ttyS0,115200". On nixos
         boot.kernelParams = [
           "console=tty1"
           "console=ttyS0,115200"
         ];
     - systemd: on standard linux distros, it is generally started by default.
       On nixos, add this to your config:
         systemd.services."serial-getty@ttyS0" = {                                      
           enable = true;                                                               
           wantedBy = [ "getty.target" ]; # to start at boot                            
           serviceConfig.Restart = "always"; # restart when session is closed           
         };
  - While on serial line, the screen size is limited, on the long run is better
    to just use ssh. To enable ssh, open the port 2222 on the host and redirect
    it to the guest 22:
      qemu -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22
    Enable sshd service on the guest. And then connect from the host to the guest:
      ssh user@localhost -p 2222


SHARED FOLDER
 - doc: https://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/9psetup
 - The virtiofs shares a folder between guest and host as is. For the guest to
   write or read into the folder, it must match the permissions on the host. In
   essence, if the folder is only writtable by a user with uid=1000, the guest
   user MUST have uid=1000. Another option is to give the folder in the host
   777 permissions.
 - create a virtio device
     qemu -virtfs local,path=./shared,mount_tag=host0,security_model=none,id=host0 \
   and then, on the guest, mount it with (on nixos)
     fileSystems."/shared" = {                                                      
       device = "host0";                                                            
       fsType = "9p";                                                               
       options = [                                                                  
         "trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L"                                            
       ];                                                                           
     }; 
   or manually
     mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L host0 /shared/

DEBUGGING
 - Debug linux kernel
    - compile kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
    - objcopy --only-keep-debug vmlinux kernel.sym # get only kernel symbols
    - qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt -S -s -kernel ./Image : -S stops qemu
      watining for gdb; -s makes gdb be able to attach through localhost:1234
    - gdb; file kernel.sym; target remote :1234

DTS
 - qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt,dumpdtb=qemu-riscv64-virt.dtb : dump qemu generated dtb
 - dtc qemu-riscv64-virt.dtb > qemu-riscv64-virt.dts : convert back dtb to dts

MEANING OF COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
 - doc: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58434837/1725759
 - "-kernel" is the "load a Linux kernel" option. It will load and boot the
   kernel in whatever way seems best for the architecture being used. For
   instance, for the x86 PC machine it will just provide the file to the guest
   BIOS and rely on the guest BIOS to do the actual loading of the file into
   RAM. On Arm, loading a Linux kernel means that we follow the rules the
   kernel lays down for how to boot it
 - "-device" loader is the "generic loader", which behaves the same on any
   architecture. It just loads an ELF image into guest RAM, and doesn't do
   anything to change the CPU reset behaviour. This is a good choice if you
   have a completely bare-metal image which includes the exception vector table
   and want to have it start in the same way the hardware would out of reset.
 - "-bios" is the "load a bios image, in whatever way seems good for this
   machine model" option. Again, this is a "do what I mean" kind of option
   whose specifics vary from machine model to machine model and from
   architecture to architecture; some machines don't support it at all. Some
   machines (eg x86 PC) will always load a bios, using a default binary if the
   user didn't specify. Some will load a bios if the user asks, but not
   otherwise (the arm virt board is like this). Generally a bios image is
   expected to be a "bare metal raw binary" image which will get loaded into
   some flash or ROM memory which corresponds to wherever the hardware starts
   execution when it comes out of reset. On at least some machines, including
   'virt', you can instead provide the contents of the flash/ROM devices using
   a command line like "-drive if=pflash,...". This is an example of a common
   pattern in QEMU where you can either use a short "do what I mean" option
   that is convenient but has a lot of magic under the hood, or a longer
   "orthogonal" option which lets you specify lots of sub-options and get
   exactly the behaviour you want. Note that BIOS images should not be ELF
   files, they're expected to just be the raw data to put into the ROMs.

RISV
 - When using "-kernel", qemu loads the image at address 0x84000000. If using
   u-boot, you might need to set the address manually:
     > setenv kernel_start 0x84000000
     > booti ${kernel_start} - ${fdtcontroladdr}
