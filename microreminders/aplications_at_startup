  # Some things that run always
  touch /var/lock/blah
  
  # Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system
  case "$1" in
    start)
      echo "Starting script blah "
      echo "Could do more here"
      ;;
    stop)
      echo "Stopping script blah"
      echo "Could do more here"

    *)
      echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/blah {start|stop}"
