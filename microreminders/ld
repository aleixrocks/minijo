BASIC
 - The linker combines input files into a single output file.
 - ld --verbose -> display default linker script
 - ld -T script.ldd -> using script.ldd instead of default script.
 - objdump -h objfile.o -> list sections
 - objdump -t objfile.o (or nm) -> list symbols

SECTIONS
 - Each section has a name and size.
 - objdump -h objfile.o -> display sections
 - input section -> input object file section
 - output section -> output object file section
 - section contents -> block of data associated to a section.
 - section maked as loadable -> the section contents should be loaded into
   memory when the output file is run.
 - allocatable section -> The area in memory should be set aside, but nothing
   should be loaded there. A section that is neither allocatable nor loadable
   typically contains some sort of debugging information.
  - Each section has two addresses (in most cases they are the same):
    - VMA (virtual memory address) -> address the section will have when the
      output file is run.
    - LMA (load memory address) -> Address at which the section will be loaded.

SYMBOLS
 - Symbol table -> Object's list of symbols
 - A symbol might be defined or undefined. A symbol is undefined when it is
   referenced in the input file but it is not defined in the source code.
 - Each symbol has a name and each defined symbol has an address.
 - Symbols are defined for eavry function and global or static variables in
   the program source code.
 - objdump -t objfile.o (or nm) -> list symbols
 - typical sections:
    - .text -> code
    - .data -> initialized data
    - .bss  -> uninitialized data

LINKER SCRIPT
 - comments like in C.
 - SECTION {} -> command used to specify the order of the sections. An example
   follows:

       SECTIONS
       {
         . = 0x10000;
         .text : { *(.text) }
         . = 0x8000000;
         .data : { *(.data) }
         .bss : { *(.bss) }
       }
   
 - . -> location counter: The current address where the next specified section
   will be placed. It is automatically incremented after specifying a section.
 - The second line defines an output section named '.text' Within the curly
   braces after the output section name, you list the names of the input
   sections which should be placed into this output section.  The `*' is a
   wildcard which matches any file name. The expression `*(.text)' means all
   `.text' input sections in all input files.
 - The linker will ensure that each output section has the required alignment,
   by increasing the location counter if necessary. For instance, in this
   example, the linker might need to create a small gap between the .data and
   .bss sections.

 - ENTRY (symbol) -> This is the entry point, is specifies the first
   instruction to execute in a program. To determine the very first entry
   point, the linker checks the following in order:
     - '-e' entry command line option
     - the ENTRY(symbol) comamnd in a linker script
     - A default value such as 'start', but there are others.
     - The address of the first byte of the '.text' section, if present.
     - The address 0.
 
 - INCLUDE filename -> include 'filement' at the exact point where INCLUDE is.
