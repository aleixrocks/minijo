 BASIC
 - The ulimit tools is used to set per-process limits such as maximum number of
   threads.
 - The limits can be set using the bash built-in "ulimit" (search it on the
   bash man page) and will only affect the processes started on this bash
   session.
 - The file /etc/security/limits.conf holds the limits for the entire system.
 - There are hard and soft limits. The soft limit is the maximum value that a
   non-privileged user can set. The hard limit is the maximum value that a
   privileged user can set. Both limits can be changed.
 - It is possible to specify "unlimited" (without quotes) to do not limit a
   given option.
