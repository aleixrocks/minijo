BASIC
 - There are two cgroups implementations v1 and v2. v2 fixes several problems
   of the v1 version such as non-uniform controllers and other non-scalable
   features that have been removed.
 - check Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt for more details.



BASIC SETUP
 - mount -t cgroup2 nodev /cgroup2 -> mount root cgroup
 - mkdir /cgroup2/group1 -> create group in root
 - mkdir /cgroup2/group1/nested1 -> crate subgroup
 - mkdir /cgroup2/group1/nested2 -> create subgroup
 - rmdir /cgroup2/group1/nested2 -> delete subgroup
 - cat /cgroup2/cgroup.controllers -> list available controllers to be enabled
   (by default none is enabled). If no controllers are listed, it is posible
   that all controlers are being used by cgroup v1 (a controller can only be
   used by a single cgroup implementation at the same time). To release the
   controllers, boot the kernel with the option "cgroup_no_v1=all"
 - echo "+cpu +memory -io" > /cgroup2/cgroup.subtree_control -> enable(+) or
   disable(-) controller for the cgroup.

PRIVILEGE DELEGATION
 - A cgroup can be delegated to a less privileged user by granting write                                                                                            
   306 access of the directory and its "cgroup.procs" file to the user.  
 - The non-root user would then be able to create further subgroups.
 - More info on this under Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt.

HOW IT WORKS
 -  Resources are distributed top-down and a cgroup can further distribute                                                                                           
    a resource only if the resource has been distributed to it from the                                                                                              
    parent.  This means that all non-root "cgroup.subtree_control" files                                                                                             
    can only contain controllers which are enabled in the parent's                                                                                                   
    "cgroup.subtree_control" file.  A controller can be enabled only if                                                                                              
    the parent has the controller enabled and a controller can't be                                                                                                  
    disabled if one or more children have it enabled.

MEMORY CONTROLLER
 - all values writen/read to the memory files are in bytes
