When an application executes a system call, we say that the kernel is
executing on behalf of the application. Furthermore, the application is 
said to be executing a system call in kernel-space, and the kernel is 
running in process context.This relationship that applications call into 
the kernel via the system call interface is the fundamental manner in which 
applications get work done.

in Linux, we can generalize that each processor is doing exactly one of three 
things at any given moment (without exceptions):
  - In user-space, executing user code in a process
  - In kernel-space, in process context, executing on behalf of a 
    specific process
  - In kernel-space, in interrupt context, not associated with a process, 
    handling an interrupt
