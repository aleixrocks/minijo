MEMORY
kernel memory is not pageable.Therefore, every byte of memory you
consume is one less byte of available physical memory. 

FLOATING POINT
Don't use it! The kernel needs to trap itself to enter in floating
point mode and it's complex. So don't do it (altough it can be done)

STACK
The kernel stack is small and fixed

if (likely(success)) { ... }   : the branch is likely to be taken
if (unlikely(success)) { ... } : the branch is unlikely to be taken

BUILD_BUG_ON(condition): the compiler will fail if condition is meet,
  it must be something that hte preprocessor can manage. If its meet,
  no code at all is generated.

kmalloc : allocate memory in user space or kernel space from kernel space.

anon_inode_getfile: create an anonymous inode for files that don't have a
  directory entry.
