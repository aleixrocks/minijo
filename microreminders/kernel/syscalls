Every syscall has an associated identifier which is defined in the file

  arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

for the x86_64 architecture.


The header of a syscall implementation is defined in a macro. Therefore,
when searching for a syscall implementation, search for the macro. For 
instance, 

SYSCALL_DEFINE3(lseek, unsigned int, fd, off_t, offset, unsigned int, whence)    
for the lseek syscall with three parameters.
