BASIC
 - Main doc file: Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt
 - Main directory: /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
 - cat available_tracers -> display available tracers
 - echo function_graph > current_tracer -> set current tracer
 - cat current_tracer -> display current tracer
 - echo 1 > tracing_on -> enables tracing
 - echo 0 > tracing_on -> disables tracing
 - cat trace | head -10 -> display the trace of all cpus
 - cat per_cpu/cpu0/trace -> display the trace for cpu0
 - echo "hello world" > trace_maker -> set marker on trace from userland at the
   time of writting
 - echo 50 > buffer_size_kb -> set buffer size per cpu
 - sysrq-z -> trigger ftrace dump

TRACERS
 - function -> records entry to functions, a bit hard to folow
 - function_graph -> records entry and exit to functions
     - "+" that is there is an annotation marker. 
     - Duration is greater than 10 microseconds, a "+" is shown.
     - Duration is greater than 100 microseconds a "!" will be displayed.

trace_printk()
 - used just like printk, but doesn't write to the screen but to the ftrace
   buffer. Hence, the overhead is way less (from several ms to a thenth of a ms)
 - it's output appears as comments in the function_graph tracer

STACK TRACE
 It doesn't use the ftrace buffer, but its infrastructe. No overhead only if
 tracing is disabled. It doesn't track interrupt stacks because they have their
 own stack and it's not easy
 - echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/stack_tracer_enabled -> enable stack tracer. 
 - add "stacktrace" to the kernel boot parameters -> to see max size during boot
 - cat stack_max_size -> print max stack size
 - echo 0 > stack_max_size -> reset max stack size
 - cat stack_trace -> print stack record of each function

FILTERS
 - filter by PID
     - echo <pid> > set_ftrace_pid -> trace for only the specified <pid>
     - echo -1 > set_ftrace_pid -> trace for any process in the system
     - cat available_filter_functions -> list all available filter functions
 - filter by function name
     - echo <function_name> > set_ftrace_filter -> trace only <function_name>.
       Multiple functions can be added to set_ftrace_filter
     - echo <function_name> > set_ftrace_notrace -> trace all functions but
       the ones written in set_ftrace_notrace.
     - echo > [set_trace_filter|set_trace_notrace] -> remove all functions
     - Is also posible to add them on the kernel command line:
         - ftrace_notrace=rcu_read_lock,rcu_read_unlock
         - ftrace_filter=kfree,kmalloc
     - Wildcards on function names
         - value*, *value* and *value
         - echo 'set*' > set_ftrace_filter
 - filter by module
     - echo ':mod:tg3' > set_ftrace_filter -> trace only functions that belong
       to the module tg3.
 - stop tracing when function hits
     - echo '<function_name:command[:cout]>' > set ftrace_filter -> when
       function_name is executed at the beginning, the command is run (which
       is typically traceoff or traceon). This will be executed "count" times
       if specified or infinite otherwise.
 - remove function from filter
     - echo '!*lock*' >> set_ftrace_filter -> the '!' symbol removes function
       listed in the filter file, wildcards are valid.

FUNCTION GRAPH
 - echo function_graph > current_tracer -> enable function graph. It records
   the entry and exit of each function. The return address in the stack of the
   process is hijaked for another one to account for timings. The real return
   address is stored in a stack in the process/thread task_struct.
 - Show name of the function in the closing brakets as a comment (disabled by
   defautl)
     hide: echo nofuncgraph-tail > trace_options                              
     show: echo funcgraph-tail > trace_options


FUNCTION PROFILING
 - This is not the function_graph tracer. The function profiler accounts for
   global usage times of internal kernel functions. By default, it includes
   the time of being scheduled out (it can be changed, see below).

     Function        Hit    Time            Avg             s^2
       --------        ---    ----            ---             ---
       __schedule   344796    4773420829 us     13844.18 us     3942666 us  
       schedule     341844    4772511744 us     13961.08 us     1762672 us  
       SyS_futex     11287    2418140234 us     214241.1 us     6249603 us  
       do_futex      11287    2418136211 us     214240.8 us     6204462 us  

 - This doesn't takes samples but the actual values.
 - If CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER is configured in the kernel, the function
   profiler will use the function graph infrastructure to record how long a
   function has been executing. If just CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER is configured,
   the function profiler will just count the functions being called.
 - The followign example includes the times that a function has been preempted
   or schedule() was called and the task was swapped out:
     - echo nop > current_tracer
     - echo 1 > function_profile_enabled
     - cat trace_stat/function0 | head
 - The following example tells ftrace to ignore the time the task was
   scheduled out. Disabling the function profiler and then re-enabling it causes
   the numbers to reset. 
     - echo 0 > options/sleep-time
     - echo 0 > function_profile_enabled
     - echo 1 > function_profile_enabled
     - cat trace_stat/function0  | head
 - Be aware of the graph-time option. By default it is enabled. When enabled,
   the times for a function include the times of all the functions that were
   called within the function. When disabled, the times only include the
   execution of the function itself, and do not contain the times of functions
   that are called from the function:
     - echo 0 > options/graph-time
     - echo 0 > function_profile_enabled
     - echo 1 > function_profile_enabled
     - cat trace_stat/function0  | head

WHO CALLS ME
  - Be careful with this option. It enables recording of stack traces for the
    selected function. If a function to trace is not specified, tracing the
    call stacks for all functions __will__ livelock the system. So check twice.

      sudo su -c "echo kfree > set_ftrace_filter"
      cat set_ftrace_filter # check again to avoid livelocks
        kfree
      sudo su -c "echo function > current_tracer"
      sudo su -c "echo 1 > options/func_stack_trace"
      cat trace | tail -5
         => __fput
         => fput
         => remove_vma
         => do_munmap
         => sys_munmap
      sudo su -c "echo 0 > options/func_stack_trace"
      sudo su -c "echo > set_ftrace_filter"

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

To use ftrace, enable:

    CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER
    CONFIG_FUNCTION_GRAPH_TRACER
    CONFIG_STACK_TRACER
    CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE

When CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE is configured the call is converted to a NOP at boot
time to keep the system running at 100% performance. During compilation the
mcount() call-sites are recorded. That list is used at boot time to convert
those sites to NOPs. Since NOPs are pretty useless for tracing, the list is
saved to convert the call-sites back into trace calls when the function (or
function graph) tracer is enabled.

The function graph tracer hijacks the return address of the function in order
to insert a trace callback for the function exit. This breaks the CPU's branch
prediction and causes a bit more overhead than the function tracer. The closest
true timings only occur for the leaf functions.


TRACE-CMD
 - trace-cmd is a command to manage the ftrace directories.
 - example:
    - trace-cmd record -e sched <command> -> starts tracing. All events are
      saved into the default file trace.dat
    - trace-cmd report -> shows the report by reading the default trace.dat
 - kernelshark gui can be used to visualize traces.
 - When recording a trace, trace-cmd will fork off a process for each CPU on
   the system. Each of these processes will open the file 
   /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/per_cpu/cpuX/trace_pipe_raw, where X is the
   processor number. Processes are not pinned and may appear on the trace.
 
 - The overrun value is the number of entries that were dropped due to the
   buffer filling up, and the writer deleting the older entries.
