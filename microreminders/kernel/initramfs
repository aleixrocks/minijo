From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10603104/the-difference-between-initrd-and-initramfs

when booting:

initrd
 - A ramdev block device is created. It is a ram-based block device, that is a
   simulated hard disk that uses memory instead of physical disks.
 - The initrd file is read and unzipped into the device, as if you did zcat
   initrd | dd of=/dev/ram0 or something similar.
 - The initrd contains an image of a filesystem, so now you can mount the
   filesystem as usual: mount /dev/ram0 /root. Naturally, filesystems need a
   driver, so if you use ext2, the ext2 driver has to be compiled in-kernel.
 - Done!
initramfs
 - A tmpfs is mounted: mount -t tmpfs nodev /root. The tmpfs doesn't need a
   driver, it is always on-kernel. No device needed, no additional drivers.
 - The initramfs is uncompressed directly into this new filesystem: zcat
   initramfs | cpio -i, or similar.
 - Done!
And yes, it is still called initrd in many places although it is a initramfs,
particularly in boot loaders, as for them it is just a BLOB. The difference is
made by the OS when it boots.
