KERNEL HEADERS

 - Kernel source files cannot include outside headers, just as they cannot 
   use outside libraries.
 - The base files are located in the include/ directory in the root of the 
   kernel source tree. For example, the header file <linux/inotify.h> is 
   located at include/linux/inotify.h in the kernel source tree.
 - A set of architecture-specific header files are located in 
   arch/<architecture>/include/asm in the kernel source tree. For example, 
   if compiling for the x86 architecture, your architec-ture-specific headers 
   are in arch/x86/include/asm . Source code includes these headers via just 
   the asm/ prefix, for example <asm/ioctl.h> .
 - Because system calls are not usual functions they don't have the usual
   header file. It's internal header file is include/kernel/syscalls.h but this
   is not exported to userspace.  To call them, the recommended way is using a
   wrapper library such as the glibc. 
     - System calls are not called as usual functions, instead a special machine
       instruction is used (depends on the architecture) which do not need even
       a stack to pass the arguments. In fact, to call a system call directly some
       assembly is needed, altough the generic syscall() function can be used. This
       function takes the number of the syscall, puts the arguments in registers,
       does de context switch (to jump to kernel space code) and sets errno 
       when returning. See man syscall and man syscalls. 

KERNEL HEADERS ON USERSPACE
 - The kernel exposes some headers to user space for some old applications that
   needs them, altough its use is discouraged if possible. These includes where
   time ago mixes with kernel include files but on 2012 a guy separeted the user
   includes in another folder. Now all headers located at the **/uapi folder
   (for user api) are copied to /usr/include/linux

GLIBC HEADERS
 - The glibc headers files are located at /user/include/${ARCH}-linux-gnu/
   If the include looks like <sys/eventfd.h>, then the file is located at
   /user/include/${ARCH}-linux-gnu/sys/eventfd.h.
