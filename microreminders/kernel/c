Modifiers
 - volatile -> the variable must be loaded from memory each time it is
   referenced instead of being loaded in a register and continue using the
   register on the following operations.

Pointers 
 - const int *iptr -> is a pointer to a read-only integer. Herewith, a pointer
   can be changed, but an integer cannot. 

 - int * const iptr -> is a constant pointer to an integer, where an int can be
   changed, but a pointer cannot be put to point elsewhere.
