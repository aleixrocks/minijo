 - From the kernel's point of view, execution of the signal handler
   code is exactly the same as the execution of any other user-space
   code.  That is to say, the kernel does not record any special
   state information indicating that the thread is currently
   excuting inside a signal handler.  All necessary state
   information is maintained in user-space registers and the user-
   space stack.  The depth to which nested signal handlers may be
   invoked is thus limited only by the user-space stack (and
   sensible software design!). (from man 7 signal)
