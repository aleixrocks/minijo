kernel/kthread.c

kernel thread can be created only by another kernel thread.The kernel handles 
this automatically by forking all new kernel threads off of the kthreadd kernel 
process

LIST OF KTHREADS
 - ksmd: The KSM daemon ksmd periodically scans those areas of user memory
   which have been registered with it, looking for pages of identical content
   which can be replaced by a single write-protected page (which is
   automatically copied if a process later wants to update its content). The
   amount of pages that KSM daemon scans in a single pass and the time between
   the passes are configured using sysfs interface. https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html

FUNCTIONS
 - kthread_create() -> creates a new kthread. It adds a request to create a kthread
     which is resolved by the kernel thread "kthreadd"


OTHERS
 - ps -ef -> show kernel threads
