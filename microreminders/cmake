BASIC
 - general use:
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     cmake --build .

SEARCH PATH
 - to specify the paths to search for a package use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:
     cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path1>;<path2>;<path3>" ..
   the paths are the root paths of the package, cmake will append /lib or /include as needed.
 - to debug where cmake searches for packages use CMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE=ON
     cmake -DCMAKE_FIND_DEBUG_MODE=ON
 - be aware that this variable can be overriden by at CMakeLists.txt
     set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH <path>)
