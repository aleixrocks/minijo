 - All work sharing constructs must be inside a parallel construct,
   otherwise they are ignored.
 - There is an implicit barrier after the parallel construct
 - There is not an implicit barrier after a work sharing construct,
   alhough it can be specified by using the nowait clause.
 - There is an implicit barrier after single construct

 - OMP_DISPLAY_ENV=[1|verbose]. use "verbose" if you want to display
   implementation-specific variables, such as KMP_BLOCKTIME.
 - OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY=1 : display where each thread is bound.
 - OMP_POLICY=[active|passive]. Whether threads spin (active) or block
   (passive) when they get out of work to do. The default is
   implementation-specific.
     - in LLVM, the default is passive, but if it is not set by the user
       explicitly, the passive meaning changes to "active" and threads will
       spin for KMP_BLOCKTIME.
 - KMP_BLOCKTIME=[10us]: Amount of time spent busy-waiting before blocking.
