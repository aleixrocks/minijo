Hello!

This is my personal micro-reminders repository. Here, I write a quick reference
of tools that I use to work, tips, tricks or general concepts summaries of
systems such as the Linux Kernel.

Much of the documentes here need a good cleanup and maybe a bit more
explanation, but It is a continuous work in progress! If you find this
interesting, I hope that it will be useful as well :-)

Happy tooling/coding! :D
