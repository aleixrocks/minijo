 - -fsanitize=address -> detect Memory access instructions will be
   instrumented to detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs. address can
   be "undefined"

 - -O{1,2,3} -> optimize code without breaking compilance. Check gcc man to see
   exactly which options enable -O1, -O2 and -O3.
 - -Ofast -> optimize still more than O3 but breaks compilance.
