 - install spack
    git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true https://github.com/spack/spack.git
    cd spack
    git checkout releases/v0.19
    . share/spack/setup-env.sh
   Next, you might need to add compilers to spack in case these are not
   detected automatically. To do so, check the compilers section.
 - an spec is the description of a package with its options and dependencies.
   in spack, a hash is calculated based on the spec.
 - some packages are not packages perse, they are interfaces such as mpi.
   Spack handles these through "virtual dependencies" A package, such as HDF5,
   can depend on the MPI interface. Other packages (openmpi, mpich, mvapich2,
   etc.) provide the MPI interface. Any of these providers can be requested for
   an MPI dependency.
 - spack options can be configured using a yaml file:
    - https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html
 - packages are installed by default at $spack/opt where $spack is the
   directory of the cloned git repo. It can be changed using the install_tree
   setting in the yaml file.
 - by default, spack builds stuff in a tmpfs. Be aware that you can run out of
   memory quickly if building something big like gcc. You can change the build
   directory if that happens, see below.
 - careful! use a clean environment to build spack packages. A dirty PATH of
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH might interfer with the spack paths. Consider using
   nix-shell --pure
 - spack uncompresses and builds packages in /tmp by default. This might
   consume system memory fast, to use another directory, set $TMPDIR to the
   desired location.
 - spack info <package> : print info about the package, including versions and
   variants
 - spack locate <package> : print the package.py path for <package>
 - spack edit <package>: edit the <package> package.py
 - A package "stage" means the location where a package is uncompressed and built.

COMPILERS
 - it is not enough for a compiler to be in the env. Spack need to be told
   about the compiler for it to use it.
 - spack compiler list: show compilers
 - spack compiler add <path> : add system compiler to spack
 - spack config edit compilers: open $EDITOR and opens
   ~/.spack/<platform>/compilers.yaml for manual edition.

SPACK LIST
 - spack list: list all packages to install
 - spack list 'py-*': list all packages to install matching the expression
 - spck compilers: list available compilers

SPACK INSTALL
 - spack install <app>+option1+option2-option3-option4@version ^<dep> %compiler
    - use + to specify per-packages options (aka variants). Use - or ~ to disable them. Use one sigil or another to avoid shell expansion.
    - use @ to specify a package version.
    - use % to specify a compiler
    - use ^ to specify a dependency. deps are specified just as normal packages
      with all the sigils as "top-level" packages.
 - spack install zlib : install package. It will install from a binary cache if
   the requested packages is found there or from source otherwhise.
 - spack install zlib %clang: install with clang compiler 
 - spack versions zlib : list available versions of package
 - spack install zlib@1.2.8 : install specific version
 - spack install zlib %glibc@6.5.0 : install with specific compiler
 - spack install zlib@1.2.8 cppflags=-O3 : install with extra
   cpplags
 - spack install tcl ^zlib@1.2.8 %clang : install tcl with a specific version
   for one of its dependencies.
 - spack install tcl ^/zqd: same as above, but refer to the specific dep with
   its hash, note the / at the beginning to denote a hash.
 - spack install hdf5 ~mpi: install hdf5 without mpi. -mpi could also be used.
 - spack install hdf5+hl+mpi ^mpich: install hdf5 with hl and mpi optional
   deps, and specify the version

SPACK UNINSTALL
 - spack uninstall zlib %gcc@6.5.0: this only works if there is only one zlib matching this spec.
 - We can use either -f (force) or -R (remove dependents as well) to remove
   packages that are required by another installed package.
     - spack uninstall -R zlib/2xc : here we use a hash
 -  spack uninstall --all zlib : uninstall all variants of zlib.

FIND INSTALLED PACKAGES
 - spack find: show installed packages
 - spack find -lf: show hash (-l) and non-empty compiler flags (-f)
 - spack find -lfd: also, show deps
 - spack graph hdf5+hl+mpi ^mpich: show graph of deps
 - spack graph --dot trilinos | dot -Tpdf > trilinos_graph.pdf

COMPILER FLAGS
 - spack accepts cppflags, cflags, cxxflags, fflags, ldflags, and ldlibs
   parameters:
     spack install zlib@1.2.8 cppflags=-O3

DEBUG PACKAGING
 - spack install --verbose <package> : install and show more info
 - spack cd <package> : go to package build folder (also try --help so see other interesting destinations)
 - spack build-env mpileaks@1.1%intel bash : open a shell with the variables used to build the package


SET CUSTOM INSTALL AND BUILD DIRECTORIES
 - use a custom config.yaml file in a "./config" directory:
     
     config:
       install_tree: /home/aleix/bsc/projects/spack/install
       build_stage:
        - /home/aleix/bsc/projects/spack/build

   and then run: spack -C ./config install gcc
 - it should also be possible to set TMPDIR instead, but I could not make it work
