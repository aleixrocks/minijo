NOTES
- gprof only samples the main thread for multithreaded applications. There is
  an ugly workaround that implies to modify the profiled application source
  code for each thread spawned.

BASIC
 - compile and link application with -pg
     gcc -pg hello.c -o hello
 - Execute the application normally. The binary will create the file gmon.out.
 - run gprof
     gprof hello gmon.out > analysis.txt
