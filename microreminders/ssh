SSH FORWARDING

ssh -X user@host: starts a forwarding daemon on "host" that will redirect
the X protocol to the machine on the ssh client. Then, the ssh client
will send the received instructions to the local X server. This looks like
the ssh client has graphical interface. Some options should be turned on
on the configuration, search somewhere.

To X forward an entire desktop:
  - xinit -- :1 (on a ctrl-Alt-F1). This starts a new xserver on 
    display 1.
  - return to (ctrl-Alt-F7)
  - export DISPLAY=:1  #Set the display to run the next graphical apps
  - ssh -X user@host
  - run startx, gnome-session, startlxde, ...
  - change to ctrl-Alt-? where ? can be 1,2,3,... In one of those there
    is the remote desktop!


When ssh hangs: <enter>~. to close it

Entering ~? during a session should give you a list. Some examples:

~ followed Ctrl-Z suspends the session,
~& puts it directly into background,
~# gives a list of forwarded connections in this session.
If you want to simply enter a tilde at the beginning of a line, you have to double it: ~~.
