GENERATE AND DEPLOY SSH KEYS
 - run the following steps on the host machine:
     - ssh-keygen -> generate keys
     - ssh-add -> add the key to the ssh agent
     - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" -> start agent (only if not started yet)
     - ssh-copy-id user@target -> copy ssh key to target machine
     - ssh user@target ls -> verify

SSH FORWARDING
 - ssh -X user@host: starts a forwarding daemon on "host" that will redirect
   the X protocol to the machine on the ssh client. Then, the ssh client
   will send the received instructions to the local X server. This looks like
   the ssh client has graphical interface. Some options should be turned on
   on the configuration, search somewhere.
 - To X forward an entire desktop:
     - xinit -- :1 (on a ctrl-Alt-F1). This starts a new xserver on 
       display 1.
     - return to (ctrl-Alt-F7)
     - export DISPLAY=:1  #Set the display to run the next graphical apps
     - ssh -X user@host
     - run startx, gnome-session, startlxde, ...
     - change to ctrl-Alt-? where ? can be 1,2,3,... In one of those there
       is the remote desktop!
   
OTHERS
 - When ssh hangs: <enter>~. to close it
 - Copy a file through ssh:
    - cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@target 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
 - Entering ~? during a session should give you a list. Some examples:
     ~ followed Ctrl-Z suspends the session,
     ~& puts it directly into background,
     ~# gives a list of forwarded connections in this session.
     If you want to simply enter a tilde at the beginning of a line, you have to double it: ~~.

Tunnel
 - create a tunnel:
     ssh -vNL 23080:localhost:23080 <proxy server>
   then set
     export  http_proxy=localhost:23080 
     export   ftp_proxy=localhost:23080
     export https_proxy=localhost:23080
