FILES AND COMMANDS
 - /proc/meminfo -> info about memory
 - /proc/cpuinfo -> info about cpu (see CPU ID's section below)
 - lscpu -> info about cpu
 - lshw -> list all hardware
 - lstopo -> list sockets, nodes, cpus, threads-per cpu and cache memory
 - lstopo --of fig map.fig; xfig map.fig; (File->export)

CPU ID's
 - cat /proc/cpuinfo
    - processor: real id used everywhere (including taskset and numactl)
    - physical id: socket id
    - core id: per socket cpu id
    - siblings: number of harware threads in this socket
    - cpu cores: number of hardware cores in this socket
 - cpus per numa node:
    - numactl --hardware
 - hardware threads:
    - lstopo-no-graphics: be aware of the cpu id's returned by lstopo. Only the
      (P#<id>) are the /proc/cpuinfo "processor" field, used everywhere. All the
      other ID's are internal.
         L2 L#0 (256KB) + L1d L#0 (32KB) + L1i L#0 (32KB) + Core L#0  <- hardware CPU 0 (this id is not used for affinity settings)
           PU L#0 (P#0)  <- hardware thread of cpu0. real id is 0
           PU L#1 (P#28) <- hardware thread of cpu0. real id is 28       
         L2 L#1 (256KB) + L1d L#1 (32KB) + L1i L#1 (32KB) + Core L#1 <- hardware CPU 1
           PU L#2 (P#1)                                                 
           PU L#3 (P#29) 
    - check all the hardware thread ids of a hardware thread (including himself):
        cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/topology/thread_siblings_list
