ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 - bootargs: The contents of this variable are passed to the Linux kernel as
   boot arguments (aka "command line").
 - bootcmd: This variable defines a command string that is automatically
   executed when the initial countdown is not interrupted.  This command is
   only executed when the variable bootdelay is also defined!
 - bootdelay: After reset, U-Boot will wait this number of seconds before it
   executes the contents of the bootcmd variable.


NETWORK
 - environment variables:
    - ipaddr: set board ip address here
    - gatewayip: set gateway ip address here
    - netmask: set subnet mask here
 - commands:
    - ping <ip_address>

INTERNALS
 - entry point: arch/riscv/start.S
 - u-boot images:
     - make u-boot.bin: raw binary
     - make u-boot: elf binary (useful for debug)
 - How device drivers work: doc/driver-model/design.rst 
 - How to debug a faulty device-tree: doc/driver-model/debug.rst 
 - Device tree bindings (should be almost the same as linux but with a few additions)
    doc/device-tree-bindings/{README,choosen,...}
 - plat (or platform) data is static data associated with a u-boot device. It
   holds info per-device wich is filled either from a device-tree node or a
   U_BOOT_DRVINFO (like device-tree but built-in in u-boot; legacy way)
 - OF_PLATFORM macro: this is a u-boot fearure where a device-tree is built
   into u-boot in a special format, more lightweight than the conventional dt
   format. Use only in extreme conditions where memory is very scarse.

DEVICE TREE
 - 'ofdata' (Open-Firmware data)
