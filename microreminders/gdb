GENERAL
 - compile with -g[0-3] o -ggdb[1-3]. To archive most amount of information
   use -ggdb3. The number means 1 (less) 2 (medium) 3 (high) amount of info
 - info gdb -> don't use man! gdb is gnu and its parictular doc in in info.
    - remember to use "i" to search!
 - to attach a remote process without sudo:
      echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
   then,
      gdb -p <pid>
 - gdb -tui -> start gdb with text user interface. It's mandatory if you want
   to use it, otherwise, a werid behaviour is expected such as not recognizing
   ctl keybidings.
 - run -> run the program
     - you can specify argumentes here. to reset arguments type "set args"
 - start -> run the program, but stop at main
 - continue -> continue execution
 - step -> execute just one step entering inside functions
 - next -> execute just one step without entering inside functions
 - fin -> execute until the current function returns
 - help command -> help!
 - where (same as bt) -> print where you are.
 - when enter is pressed without typing a command, last comand is used.
 - backtrace (bt) -> print stack trace. On functions call, if we see
   something like name_function=@ffbef014, we know that the 
   first parameter of the function is allocated in ffbef014
 - x address -> examine the address, get the value.
 - frame n (f n) -> change stack frame (a frame is a function call info stored
   in the stack, each call one frame). Displays args and local vars.
 - up, down -> go up and down on the stack frames
 - to restart gdb from the beginning, just type "run"

ATTACH AND DEATACH
 - attach processID -> debug an alreeady running process. The process
   will halt unitl gdb exit.
 - deatch -> deatach process so it can continue executing normaly

VARIABLES
 - info variables -> list "All global and static variable names"
 - info locals -> list "local variables of the current stack frame"
 - info args -> list arguments of the current stack frame
 - info registers (i r)  eax -> display register eax
 - p $ead -> display register eax
 - x/16xb $edx+0x14 -> print memory 0x14(%edx). See memory below.
 - print or p nomVar/nomFuncio -> print variable. Variable must be 
   abailable on the current context. We can flip context with "frame". 
   You can typecast a variable by typing print (char) variable.
 - ptype or pt nomvar-> print type of variable
 - p myarray[3]@5 -> print 5 elements of myarray from 3t position.
 - set print pretty -> print more pretty structs and stuff
 - print /FMT variable -> where /FMT is
      o octal, x hex, d decimal, u unsigned decimal,t binary, 
      f float, a address, c char
 - print *(&a) -> just like c. & gets address and * value.
 - set variable = value -> give value to variable
 - printf "X = %d, Y = %d\n",X,Y -> just like C


MEMORY
 - x/nfu addr or x addr -> Use the x command to examine memory. n, f, and u are
   all optional parameters that specify how much memory to display and how to
   format it; addr is an expression giving the address where you want to start
   displaying memory. If you use defaults for nfu, you need not type the slash
   ‘/’. Several commands set convenient defaults for addr.
     - n, the repeat count. The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default
       is 1. It specifies how much memory (counting by units u) to display. If
       a negative number is specified, memory is examined backward from addr. 
     - f, the display format. The display format is one of the formats used by
       print (‘x’, ‘d’, ‘u’, ‘o’, ‘t’, ‘a’, ‘c’, ‘f’, ‘s’), and in addition ‘i’
       (for machine instructions). The default is ‘x’ (hexadecimal) initially.
       The default changes each time you use either x or print. 
     - u, the unit size. The unit size is any of:
         - b Bytes. 
         - h Halfwords (two bytes). 
         - w Words (four bytes). This is the initial default. 
         - g Giant words (eight bytes).
       Each time you specify a unit size with x, that size becomes the default
       unit the next time you use x. For the ‘i’ format, the unit size is
       ignored and is normally not written. For the ‘s’ format, the unit size
       defaults to ‘b’, unless it is explicitly given. Use x /hs to display
       16-bit char strings and x /ws to display 32-bit strings. The next use of
       x /s will again display 8-bit strings. Note that the results depend on
       the programming language of the current compilation unit. If the
       language is C, the ‘s’ modifier will use the UTF-16 encoding while ‘w’
       will use UTF-32. The encoding is set by the programming language and
       cannot be altered. 
     - addr, starting display address -> addr is the address where you want gdb
       to begin displaying memory. It can be an operation such as: %edx + 0x14.

SHARED LIBRARIES
 - info sharedlibraries -> report memory mapping of shared libraries. This is
   very useful to see whichs libs have debug symbols.
 - info [symbol|variable|function] <name> -> report info about symbol/var/fun

BREAKPOINTS
 - break functionname/linenumber -> new breakpoint
 - rbreak -> set multiple breakpoints given a regular expression
 - condition numBreakpoint variaable1==variable2 -> make numBreakpoint 
   breakpoint execute only when condition is true.
 - info breakpoints -> show breakpoints
 - step -> execute just one step entering inside functions
 - next -> execute just one step without entering inside functions
 - disable n -> disable breakpoint n
 - enable n -> enable breakpoint n
 - clear -> remove by its location
 - delete -> remove by its identifier
 - commands -> specify gdb commands to run when the breakpoint is reached.

WATCHPOINTS
 - watchpoints monitor memory location access. There are hardware and
   software. software works by single-stepping and rechecking the value for
   changes.
 - show can-use-hw-watchpoints -> if 1, you have hardware support.
 - watch -l <variable> -> watch for writes on the specified variable VALUE.
   We need  -l for gdb to compute the addres of the VALUE and monitor even
   when we are out of the scope of the variable.
 - rwatch -l <variable> ->  monitor reads to variable
 - awatch -l <variable> -> monitor both read and writes to the varaible

LIST
 - list or "l" -> list code
	 - starting with some line number	(gdb) list 5,
	 - ending with some line number		(gdb) list ,28
	 - between two numbers:			(gdb) list 21,25
	 - by function name:			(gdb) list f
	 - functions in the other file:		(gdb) list CentralDiff
	 - by filename and line number:		(gdb) list derivative.c:12
	 - filename and function name:		(gdb) list derivative.c:ForwardDiff
	 - list - -> print just before last printed
 - set listsize 5 -> change list size

LOCALIZATION
 - frame -> returns frame where gdb is it. frame is the header of a 
   function call stored on the stack.
 - frame numFrame -> swtich to numFrame so variables are available.
 - up n -> go up n frames
 - down n -> go down n frames
 - where -> print where you are.
 - bt -> print stack trace

MULTI-THREAD DEBUGGING
 - info thread -> list current executing threads on cpu's
 - thread <thread-id> -> switch to selected thread
 - thread <name> -> assign name to thread

MULTI-PROCESS DEBUGGING
 - by default, gdb only follows the parent on fork, the child runs freely
   outside the scope of gdb
     - set detach-on-fork off -> keep forks under the control of gdb, suspended
 - by default, on continue, next or step, only threads of the current process
   are allowed to run.
     - set schedule-multiple on -> all threads of all processes are allowed to run
       on continue, next or step.
 - by default, there are events such as process creation that will stop gdb. if
   we want processes to run freely until we stop them use:
     - set non-stop on

BATCH EXECUTION
 - say you don't want to enter the interactive mode of gdb, just want to
   execute some commands, exit and get the ouptut. batch mode is for you!
 - gdb -batch -ex "command1" -ex "command2" -ex "command3" ... : run in batch mode

CHECKPOINTS
 - checkpoint -> store current process status
 - restart idcheckpoing -> restart program since checkpoint
 - info checkpoints -> list all chekpoints and idcheckpoints

CORE DUMP
 - A core dump is a file automatically generated when an application crashes.
   This file can be used to debug the program at the moment when it crashed.
   Among other things, it can be used to check the backtrace and the value of
   the variables.
 - To activate automatic core dump files:
      ulimit -c unlimited; (check with ulimit -a)
 - Core dump are usually stored in /var/cache/abrt or in the current directory.
   If not there, check man core for a detailed explanation.
 - [/proc/sys/kernel/]core_pattern is used to specify a core dumpfile pattern name.
   echo "core.%e.%p" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern to create the core dump
   file in current directory itself, with name "core.giis.12344". Check
   /usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt for more info.
 - A core dump file can be examined with gdb path/to/the/binary path/to/the/core

MACROS
 - gdb loades the .gdbinit located in the current directory or in ~/.gdbinit.
   This file can contain definitions of custom macros.
 - source ./gdbinit -> reload gdbinit file while gdb is running. This will
   override currently defined macros but won't delete already defined ones.

LD_PRELOAD
 - to debug an application using LD_PRELOAD:
    gdb --args env LD_PRELOAD=$YOURLIB taskset -c 0 ls

OTHERS
 - call x() -> call function (yes! during execution time!)
 - To run a program several times until it crashes:
     - set pagination off # disable gdb output scroll buffer
     - break exit
     - commands
     - run
     - end

GDB TEXT USER INTERFACE (GDBTUI)
 - gdb -tui -> start gdb with TUI, mandatory or things won't work well if
   tui mode is activated with gdb un withouth -tui.
 - These are the following available views (at most 2 windows)
     - source only,
     - assembly only,
     - source and assembly,
     - source and registers, or
     - assembly and registers.

 - key-bindings
    - C-x C-a, C-x a, C-x A -> Enter or leave the TUI mode. 
    - C-x 1 Use a TUI layout with only one window. The layout will either be
      ‘source’ or ‘assembly’. When the TUI mode is not active, it will switch to
      the TUI mode.
    - C-x 2 Use a TUI layout with at least two windows. When the current layout
      already has two windows, the next layout with two windows is used. 
    - C-x o Change the active window (focus). 
    - C-x s Switch in and out of the TUI SingleKey mode that binds single keys to
      gdb commands (to avoid use control).  
    - C-L Refresh the screen.
    - The following key bindings only work in the TUI mode to navigate source
      <PgUp>, <PgDn>, <Up>, <Down>, <Left>, <Right>
   
 - commands
   
    - tui enable -> Activate TUI mode. 
    - tui disable -> Disable TUI mode.
    - info win -> List and give the size of all displayed windows. 
    - layout <name> -> Changes which TUI windows are displayed. 
        - next -> Display the next layout. 
        - prev -> Display the previous layout. 
        - src -> Display the source and command windows. 
        - asm -> Display the assembly and command windows. 
        - split -> Display the source, assembly, and command windows. 
        - regs -> When in src layout display the register, source, and command
            windows. When in asm or split layout display the register,  assembler, 
            and command windows.
   
    - focus <name> -> Changes which TUI window is currently active for scrolling.
      The name parameter can be any of the following:
        - next -> Make the next window active for scrolling. 
        - prev -> Make the previous window active for scrolling. 
        - src -> Make the source window active for scrolling. 
        - asm -> Make the assembly window active for scrolling. 
        - regs -> Make the register window active for scrolling. 
        - cmd -> Make the command window active for scrolling.
   
    - refresh -> Refresh the screen. This is similar to typing C-L. 
    - tui reg <group> -> Changes the register group displayed in the tui register
      window to group. If the register window is not currently displayed this command
      will cause the register window to be displayed. The list of register groups, as
      well as their order is target specific. The following groups are available on
      most targets:
        - next -> next one
        - prev -> previous one
        - general -> Display the general registers. 
        - float -> Display the floating point registers. 
        - system -> Display the system registers. 
        - vector -> Display the vector registers. 
        - all -> Display all registers.
   
    - update -> Update the source window and the current execution point. 
    - winheight <name> [+|-]count -> Change the height of the window name by count 
      lines. The name parameter: src, cmd, asm or regs 
    - tabset nchars -> Set the width of tab stops to be nchars characters. This
      setting affects the display of TAB characters in the source and assembly
      windows.
   
 - search source file
    - list *(function+offset) -> where offset is hexa 0x137 for instance and
      function a function name.

DISASSEMBLE
 - disassemble a function oneliner (similar to objdump -S)
     gdb -batch -ex "file $EXECUTABLE" -ex "disassemble/rs $FUNCTION"


SOURCE CODE
 - gdb source code search path rules:
     https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Source-Path.html
 - gdb searches source files at $cwd (current working directory) and $cdir
   (build directory recoreded in the debug info, if present).
 - You can add additional paths with the "dir" command.
 - you can add simple substitution rules:
     (gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/include /mnt/include
     (gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src /mnt/src
   GDB would then rewrite /usr/src/include/defs.h into /mnt/include/defs.h by
   using the first rule. However, it would use the second rule to rewrite
   /usr/src/lib/foo.c into /mnt/src/lib/foo.c.

OTHER COMMANDS
    - command linux size: size of elements of an object file .o
    - command linux strip: extirpa trosos d'un executable, com la 
      seccio .text or la symbol table

       def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):
         print ("Hello, World!")
     HelloWorld () # needed to register the command
 - var = gdb.parse_and_eval("myvar") -> load an inferior's variable into
   python. var is a gdb.Value object. The string can be more complex, like a
   ponter dereference.
 - var.address -> get address of object
 - str(var) -> get string representation of var
 - vartype = var.type -> gdb.Type object
 - vartype.sizeof -> size in bytes of the type. if an array, this returns the whole array size.
 - str(var) == "0x0" -> check if var is NULL
